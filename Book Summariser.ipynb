While studying at Ingolstadt University, he succeeds in animating a grotesque creature assembled from various body parts. Horrified by his creation, Victor abandons it.  The creature, abandoned and alone, learns language and basic human interaction by secretly observing a family of cottagers. However, due to his monstrous appearance, he is rejected and becomes embittered, vowing revenge on his creator.\n",
            "\n",
            "The creature demands that Victor create a female companion for him, promising to disappear with her into the wilderness of South America and never trouble humanity again. Victor initially agrees, fearing for the safety of his loved ones. However, he is tormented by the idea of a race of monsters being created and destroys the female companion before completing it.  Enraged, the creature murders Victor's younger brother, William, and frames the family servant, Justine Moritz, who is subsequently executed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Driven by grief and guilt, Victor retreats to the mountains seeking solace, but encounters his creation, who reiterates his demand. Victor refuses and returns home, where he marries his cousin Elizabeth. However, on their wedding night, the creature fulfills his promise of revenge, murdering Elizabeth.  Consumed by grief and a burning desire for revenge, Victor dedicates his life to hunting down the monster, pursuing him across various landscapes, eventually reaching the Arctic.\n",

Walton then encounters the creature, mourning over Victor's body. The creature expresses remorse for his actions but also blames Victor for his misery. He vows to end his own life by setting himself on fire on a remote ice floe, disappearing from human sight forever.\n",

Victor Frankenstein creates life, but then abandons his creation, refusing to take responsibility for its well-being. This leads to disastrous consequences, highlighting the ethical implications of scientific advancement and the responsibilities that come with creating life, whether natural or artificial.  The novel questions the limits of human ambition and the dangers of playing God.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Nature vs. Nurture:** The creature is born innocent, but society's rejection and Victor's abandonment turn it into a monster. This explores the question of whether inherent nature or upbringing and environment are more influential in shaping an individual's character.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Isolation and Loneliness:** Both Victor and the creature suffer from profound loneliness. Victor isolates himself from his family and friends to pursue his scientific ambitions and later to deal with the consequences. The creature, rejected by society due to its appearance, longs for connection and companionship but is met only with fear and hostility. This emphasizes the human need for connection and the devastating effects of isolation.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Prejudice and Injustice:** The creature is judged solely on its appearance and treated with cruelty and injustice. This highlights the dangers of prejudice and the importance of looking beyond superficial appearances.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Revenge:**  Driven by anger and a sense of injustice, the creature seeks revenge on its creator.  Victor, in turn, dedicates himself to hunting down and destroying his creation. This cycle of revenge demonstrates its destructive nature and how it consumes those who embrace it.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **The Sublime Power of Nature:** The natural world, especially the Alps, offers Victor moments of peace and solace, contrasting with the darkness of his actions.  Descriptions of sublime landscapes emphasize the power and beauty of nature and its ability to both inspire and console.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Loss and Grief:**  The novel is punctuated by loss and the overwhelming grief it brings.  Victor experiences the deaths of his loved ones, while the creature endures the pain of rejection and isolation. This underscores the fragility of human life and the profound impact of loss.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Ambition and its Limits:** Victor's ambition to transcend the limits of human knowledge leads to his downfall. This warns against unchecked ambition and the dangers of pursuing knowledge without considering the ethical implications.\n",
