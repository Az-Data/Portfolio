            "* **Creation and consequence:**  The novel explores the dangers of unchecked ambition and the unforeseen consequences of playing God. Victor Frankenstein's creation of the monster leads to tragedy and ruin for himself and his loved ones.  This theme also touches on the responsibility of a creator for their creation.\n",
            "* **Nature vs. nurture:** The monster is initially innocent and desires acceptance, but society's rejection and Victor's abandonment turn him into a vengeful creature. This raises questions about the inherent nature of humanity and the role of external influences in shaping an individual's character.\n",
            "* **Isolation and loneliness:** Both Victor and the monster experience profound isolation. Victor isolates himself through his obsession with his work, and the monster is shunned by society due to his appearance.  The text explores the devastating effects of loneliness on the human psyche.\n",
            "* **Prejudice and injustice:** The monster faces prejudice and fear simply because of his appearance, leading to his exclusion from human society. This theme critiques societal biases and the ways in which they can lead to injustice and suffering.\n",
            "* **The pursuit of knowledge and ambition:** Victor's relentless pursuit of scientific knowledge and his ambition to achieve something extraordinary ultimately lead to his downfall. The novel questions the boundaries of scientific exploration and the potential dangers of unchecked ambition.\n",
            "* **Revenge and justice:**  The cycle of revenge that consumes both Victor and the monster highlights the destructive nature of this pursuit. The novel questions what true justice is and whether revenge can ever truly bring closure or peace.\n",
            "* **Loss and grief:** The novel is filled with loss and the profound grief that accompanies it. Victor experiences the deaths of his loved ones, and the monster grieves the loss of potential companionship and acceptance.  The exploration of grief and its different manifestations is central to the novel.\n",
            "* **The sublime and the grotesque:** Shelley uses vivid descriptions of nature's beauty and power, contrasting them with the grotesque and monstrous form of the creature. This duality creates a powerful and unsettling atmosphere, reflecting the complex themes of the novel.\n",
            "* **Family and domesticity:** The importance of family and domestic connections is emphasized throughout the novel, particularly in Victor's early life and his longing for those connections later on.  The monster's desire for a family of his own further underscores this theme.\n",
            "\n",
