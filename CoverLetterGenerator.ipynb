    "Challenge: In my most recent engagement, I worked on a project with the Health & Safety team within Transport for NSW. The aim of the project was to consolidate health and safety data from all areas of the organization so it could be effectively utilized by the Health & Safety team.\n",
    "In my most recent role as a Data Visualization Engineer at Transport for NSW, I was involved in a project focused on consolidating health and safety data from different parts of the organisation. This involved building business-facing Power BI reports and developing the necessary Power BI infrastructure. I utilized DAX and Power Query to create advanced reports and Power BI apps tailored to the business needs. Specifically, I employed DAX to calculate and visualize Health and Safety KPIs. I also developed reports and datasets across two separate Power BI workspaces, leveraging Power Query to automate data extraction when saving into different workspaces.\n",
    "These Power BI reports were connected to a Snowflake database, where I used SQL scripts to validate, analyse, troubleshoot, and test the data consumed by the reports. This included developing scripts to ensure proper data masking within the Snowflake views. Over the course of two years, I worked through multiple production releases, each introducing new data sources and requiring updates to the Power BI reports, datasets, and models.\n",
    "Additionally, I always create and maintain very detailed documentation for myself, other developers, and end users to reference. The documentation I created for my last role was around 100 pages long, discussing the technical solution and all the configurations for the Power BI environment. On top of that, I created walkthrough videos for each of the Power BI reports for users and stakeholders. \n",

    "Role and achievements: I was responsible for creating business-facing Power BI reports and building the Power BI infrastructure for the Health & Safety team. Delivered solution included: \n",
    "-\tDeveloped data models\n",

    "Role and achievements: I was the primary developer responsible for building an ETL solution to ingest analytics data on GCP. By utilizing GCP Python APIs and Google's serverless container service, I ingested and transformed multiple files that were continually updated from Google Cloud Storage into BigQuery. I then presented the final solution to stakeholders, along with detailed documentation enabling other developers to replicate and extend the solution.\n",
