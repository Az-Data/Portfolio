Vulnerability Myths  
#3 Vulnerability is letting it all hang out  
Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust. It's not oversharing, it's not purging, it's not indiscriminate disclosure, and it's not celebrity-style social media information dumps. Vulnerability is about sharing our feelings and our experiences with people who have earned the right to hear them. Being vulnerable and open is mutual and an integral part of the trust-building process.



*Daring Greatly*  
Shoring appropriately, with boundaries, means shoring with people with whom we've developed relationships that can bear the weight of our story. The result of this mutually respectful vulnerability is increased connection, trust, and engagement. It is an incremental process. We need to feel trust to be vulnerable, and we need to be vulnerable in order to trust.
